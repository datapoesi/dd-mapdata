**dd-mapdata**

**What?** A map showing how population density of Swedish municipalities correlates with the locations of different places, such as hospitals and power plants.

**Why?** I like maps, and therefore wanted to learn how to create and modify maps that are web-based. Before this project, I only really knew about Google Maps. And now, after completion, I think I have a much better understanding of all the different options that are available for creating web-based maps. Also, the whole thing was as much an exercise in finding the data as it was in learning how to apply it to a map.
